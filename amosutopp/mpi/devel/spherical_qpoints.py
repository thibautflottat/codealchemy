def get_prune_distance(
        max_points: int,
        q_max: float,
        q_vol: float,
) -> NDArray[float]:
    r"""Determine distance in q-space beyond which to prune
    the q-point mesh to achieve near-isotropic sampling of q-space.

    If points are selected from the full mesh with probability
    :math:`\min(1, (q_\mathrm{prune} / |q|)^2)`, q-space will
    on average be sampled with an equal number of points per radial unit
    (for :math:`q > q_\mathrm{prune}`).

    The general idea is as follows.
    We know that the number of q-points inside a radius :math:`Q` is given by

    .. math:

        n = v^{-1} \int_0^Q dq 4 \pi q^2 = v^{-1} 4/3 \pi Q^3

    where :math:`v` is the volume of one q-point.  Now we want to find
    a distance :math:`P` such that if all points outside this radius
    are weighted by the function :math:`w(q)` the total number of
    q-points will equal the target :math:`N` (:attr:`max_points`)
    while the number of q-points increases linearly from :math:`P`
    outward. One additional constraint is that the weighting function
    must be 1 at :math:`P`. The weighting function which accomplishes
    this is :math:`w(q)=P^2/q^2`

    .. math:

        N = v^{-1} \left( \int_0^P 4 \pi q^2 + \int_P^Q 4 \pi q^2 P^2 / q^2 dq \right).

    This results in a `cubic equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation>`_
    for :math:`P`, which is solved by this function.

    max_q

    r"""Generates all q-points in the first octant of the reciprocal
    lattice inside a given radius :attr:`q_max`.  This approach is
    suitable if an isotropic sampling of q-space is desired.  The
    function returns the resulting q-points in Cartesian coordinates
    as an ``Nx3`` array.

    If the number of q-points generated exceeds :attr:`max_points`,
    points will be randomly pruned.  If the number of generated
    q-points exceeds :attr:`max_points`, q-points will be randomly
    removed in such a way that the q-points inside are roughly
    uniformly distributed with respect to :math:`|q|`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cell
        real cell with cell vectors as rows
    q_max
        maximum norm of generated q-points
    max_points
        Optionally limit the set to approximately :attr:`max_points`
        points by randomly removing points from a "fully populated
        mesh". The points are removed in such a way that for
        :math:`q > q_\mathrm{prune}`, the points will be radially uniformly
        distributed. The value of :math:`q_\mathrm{prune}` is
        calculated from :attr:`max_q`, :attr:`max_points`, and the
        shape of the cell.
    seed
        Seed used for stochastic pruning
